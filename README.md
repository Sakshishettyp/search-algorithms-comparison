# search-algorithms-comparison
Consider the problem of counting occurrences of a given value x within a sorted array a. For example, if
x = 5 and a = [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9], then the count is 2.
i. Write a function that solves this problem by performing a linear scan.
ii. Next, write a function that solves this problem by performing binary searches.
iii. Finally, benchmark your two functions for random sorted arrays of size 10, 100, ..., up to
10,000,000. How does performance compare between the two functions?
